# Awesome LTS - Proprietary Software

LTS editions are typically an open-source practice. They're uncommon but not unheard of in proprietary software. 

**Software listed here does not allow you to run it for any purpose, study, modify or distribute the source code.** Some of the software here may not be audited due to its closed source nature, and can therefore contain anti-features, such as but not limited to: undisclosed security vulnerabilities, backdoors, user lock-in, sending personal data to a third party.
